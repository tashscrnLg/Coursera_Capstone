However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet.

    "\n",
    "    a. The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood.\n",

    "    b.  Only process the cells that have an assigned borough. Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page,       M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    d. If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    e. Clean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making.\n",
